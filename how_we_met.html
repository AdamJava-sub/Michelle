            <h2>Our First Encounter</h2>
            <p> We met at the tennis center. I had the opportunity to watch her and her friend play. Unfortunately, I had to take them off the court they were playing on, and they went to the wall. I later returned to play on that same court. Michelle noticed me and my good playing skills, and she approached me with a question. At that moment, she seemed magical and amazing to me.<br><br>

                After that, I found myself talking with her friend and Michelle at the same time, and slowly over time, I realized I was falling in love with her. We met a few times before we officially got together, enjoying fun experiences, traveling to different places, laughing, and simply getting to know each other.<br><br>
                
                On August 27, 2023, we were in Tel Aviv, where we dined, relaxed, and played tennis. On our way back to the train station, I couldn't hold back my feelings and wanted her to be mine.<br><br>
                
                A year has passed since then, and it has been a very challenging, long year filled with endless experiences. Weâ€™ve gone through both good moments and less favorable ones, but the most important thing is that we have grown and learned from them. I am the happiest with her, and I wish for us many more years of joy together.
